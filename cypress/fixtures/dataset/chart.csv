POSSIBLE ROLE OF WETLANDS, PERMAFROST, and destabilization of marine hydrates may affect the climate system. It is likely that methane wetland emissions will increase over the next century. Uncertainties arise from the temperature dependence of emissions and changes in the geographical distribution of wetland areas. Another major concern is the possible degradation or thaw of terrestrial permafrost due to climate change. The amount of carbon stored in permafrost
Bird population trends are linearly affected by climate change along species thermal ranges,2010, while those breeding close to the species thermal minimum have higher growth rates. These results were maintained even after having controlled for the effect of latitude per se. Therefore

The effect of aqueous sulphate on basaltic glass dissolution rates,2010, the presence of 0.01 mol/kg sulphate doubled the dissolution rate while 0.10 mol/kg of sulphate tripled the dissolution rate compared to that measured in sulphate-free solutions. This rate increase is found to be consistent with that calculated using an equation previously proposed by Gislason and Oelkers (2003)
